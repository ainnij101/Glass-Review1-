  <strong><u><h1> Facade Specificaiton requirements </h1></u></strong>
<br><br>
  <strong><u><h3> 7.6.3	VISUAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA </h3></u></strong>
<p>
The glass shall be clean cut, without significant edge faults (including feathered edges, shells or other imperfections) and free from bubbles,
inclusions, cracks ripping dimples or other defects.  Distortion shall be kept to an absolute minimum and no local defects producing irregular
reflections shall be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>The quality of all glass shall be assessed for optical and visual faults as described in BS EN 572-2 and the requirement specified in section 7.6.1,
7.6.6 and 7.6.7 of this Specification</strong>. <strong>Spot faults shall not be worse than category C</strong>. <strong>There shall be no linear/extended faults.
For optical faults,acceptance levels shall be as described in the standard.</strong></p>
<p>In the absence of a British standard covering <strong>visual process blemishes in laminated glass, reference shall be made to ASTM C 1172 Table 3 for architectural quality glass.</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise accepted by the Contract Administrator, three (3) 1x1m glass samples of each type, with the same tinting, heat treatment, coating and build-up, shall be
 submitted, prior to commencement on site, showing the final quality of the finished glass. The sample shall be to a standard agreed by the Contract Administrator.</p>
 <p>The accepted trial samples shall be kept by the Contract Administrator as control samples (benchmark) of the acceptable range of visual deviations.
Also refer to <strong>section 7.6.1, 7.6.6, 7.6.7 and 9.4.2,</strong> for acceptance criterion on glass visual quality.</p>
<p>
<strong><u><h3> 7.6.1	GENERAL </h3></u></strong>
<p>Glass shall comply with the standards as specified in section 6 and the description in section 5.2.8 of this Specification.</p>
<p>Submit samples of glass in accordance with SCHEDULE 2.</p>
<p>The thickness and dimensions of glass shown on the Drawings are not prescribed thickness or dimensions.
  The Contractor shall calculate the required glass thickness using the minimum
  thickness principle to meet the structural, thermal, environmental, acoustic and safety requirements.
Test report shall be prepared by the recognised independent test laboratory shall be submitted and reviewed without objection by the Contract Administrator prior to material ordering.</p>
One hundred percent heat soaking shall be required for all glass exceeding surface and edge stresses of 7500psi (52 N/mm²).  Contractor shall submit heat soak process and QC program for
 review without objection by Contract Administrator to ensure conformance with requirements listed in EN 14179 with calibrated heat soak ovens.  Temperature-time curve for heat soak testing
 of each batch of processed glass shall be recorded real-time and be witnessed by representative of the Contractor.  All heat soak test records issued by the glass manufacturer and countersigned
 by the contractor shall be submitted to the Contract Administrator for review following delivery of glass to the assembly factory or to site.
Heat-treated glass such as Heat strengthened glass and tempered glass shall be examined by the glass manufacturer to detect and discard any lites
which exceed the following tolerances:</p>
<p>1)	Glass that has any deviation from flat (bow) of 0.10% of the shortest glass dimension.</p>
<p>2)	Where the heat treating process results in essentially parallel ripples or waves (roller waves), the deviation from flatness at any peak
  shall not exceed 0.13mm, and the difference between adjacent peaks shall not exceed 0.08mm.</p>
<p>3)	Where bow tolerance and roller wave tolerance differ, the stricter requirements shall govern.
<p>4)	Direction of ripples shall be horizontal, consistent, and in conformance with architectural design.
The appearance of anisotropy or "Leopard Spots", a multi-coloured pattern, is known to be associated with heat treated glass under certain polarised lighting conditions.  This shall not be considered a fault unless it is visible in a range of reasonably typical naturally occurring conditions.  Any coatings applied to the glass must not increase the tendency to show these effects and samples must be submitted to the Contractor Administrator for review without objection.  Control samples, as indicated in SCHEDULE 2, shall be submitted for review without objection prior to ordering of the HKPM project glass.</p>
<p>5)	Bubbles and inclusions in glass panels are considered as unacceptable.</p>
